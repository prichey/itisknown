Defunct Twitter bot [@menemnesa](https://twitter.com/menemnesa).

Looked for tweets containing 'let it be known' and responded 'it is known'. Muzzled for violating [Twitter TOS](https://support.twitter.com/articles/76915) (you aren't allowed to automate sending unsolicited replies).

Was fun while it lasted.
